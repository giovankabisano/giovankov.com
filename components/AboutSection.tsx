              Hi, I&#39;m Giovanka but people called me Ivan for short. I have the expertise in Android Development and I am familiar with React also, so I can do some web programming as well.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I worked at various top-tier companies in Indonesia since 2019 after 
              I graduated from Brawijaya University with a CS in Computer Engineering and have been working in the
              field ever since.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Managerial path is the career ladder that I want to achieve and people that have worked with me said that I am suitable for that ðŸ˜†
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I love to talk about business and peoples. <br></br>Fun fact, I have my own coffe shop but I <b>don&#39;t</b> like coffee.
            </p>
